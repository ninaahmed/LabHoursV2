# LabHoursV2
Lab Hours Version 2

This application is meant to make the process of getting in line
for lab hours easier for students and instructors. Students would
be able to see how many people are ahead of them and can be notified
when their turn is coming up soon without having to be in the lab.

The lab would be less busy, the instructors wouldn't have to keep
yelling out names, and the students could leave the line online as
needed.
